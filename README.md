# Linux notes and cheatsheet

My notebook for the configs that I made on my system, and all the tricks and commands that I need to remember. 
I'll add more things here gradually as I learn.

## Index

- [Configs that I made on my system](./Arch-install-and-after-that.md) (I write them down here so I don't forget them!)
- [A fix to set Persian (Farsi) font systemwide](./Set-Persian-Font-Globally.md)
